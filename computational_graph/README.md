# Computational Graph C++ Implementation

- This is a very simple (probably incomplete) implementation of a computational graph as explained in lecture 4 in C++, but I made it to get a better intuition for the computational graph and get my hands dirty.
- I only implemented **Scaler Addition/Multiplication** forward & backward passes.
- The main.cpp file contains an example.
