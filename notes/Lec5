-ConvNet filters.
-ConvNet is a sequence of conv layers, interspersed with activation functions (e.g. ReLU).
-Hierarchical filters (slide 37).
-Filters applied with stride.
-Output size after stride: (slide 52)
    -SZ = (N - F) / stride + 1
    -N is size of image.
    -F is size of filter.
    -SZ should be a whole number.
-Zero Padding (slide 55).
-Summary (slide 62).
-Convolution parameters tips (slide 64).
-Pooling layer makes teh representation smaller & more manageable.
    -Max Pooling.
    -Use strides to avoid overlapping.
    -Pooling Summary (slide 75).
-Pooling is like the accumulation of all the processing done by the filters.
-Fully Connected Layer.

-Typical architechtures.
    -[(CONV-RELU)*N-POOL]*M-(FC-RELU)*K, SOFTMAX.
    -N is usually up to ~5m, M is large, 0 <= K <= 2.
