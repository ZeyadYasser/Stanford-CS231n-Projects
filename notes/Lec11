-Semantic Segmentation
    -Sliding Window (Naive, Very Inefficient)
    -Fully Convolutional
    -Downsampling & upsampling inside the network for efficiency
    -Nearest Neighbour upsampling, Bed of Nails, Max Unpooling
    -Learnable upsampling: Transpose Convolution
-Classification + Localization
    -Output class scores & box coordinates (slide 47)
    -Weighted sum of two losses (scores & box coordinates)
    -Human Pose Estimation (slide 51)
-Object Detection
    -Region Proposals (selective search)
    -R-CNN
    -Fast R-CNN
    -Faster R-CNN
    -YOLO (One forward pass)
    -SSD
-Instance Segmentation
    -Mask R-CNN (Also does Pose Estimation)
